Do I contradict myself?

Very well then I contradict myself,

(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

Do I contradict myself?··
Very well then I contradict myself,··
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!
